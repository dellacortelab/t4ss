    remove container item

      UNIT/RESIDUE/ATOM          _container_
      UNIT/RESIDUE/ATOM          _item_

Remove the object _item_ from the object _container_.
If _item_ is not contained by _container_ then an error message will be
displayed.  This command is used to remove ATOMs from RESIDUEs, and
RESIDUEs from UNITs.  If the object represented by _item_ is not
referenced by some variable name then it will be destroyed.

Error: remove: Argument #2 is type String must be of type: [molecule residue atom]
usage:  remove <unit/residue/atom> <unit/residue/atom>
