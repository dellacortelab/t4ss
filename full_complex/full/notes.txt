Command used to solvate (We used a 60x60x60 box):

    python2 insane.py -f full_cg.pdb -o system.gro -p system.top -x 60 -y 60 -z 60 -sol W -salt 0

For the .top, the included example.top has all the molecule types in proper order.
The includes are listed for a path accessible by ../itps/*.itp from the run directory.

I've also included the .mdp files and the submission script we used, but you can use whatever works with the lipids.
