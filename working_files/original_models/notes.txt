For the OMC, both DotF and IcmE have disjointed chains.
I am splitting these chains into two pieces for martinizing purposes.

IcmE Upper: AG,BG,CG,DG,EG,FG,GG,HG,IR,JG,KG,LG,MG,NG,OM,PG
IcmE Lower: Ag,Bg,Cg,Dg,Eg,Fg,WG,Gg,Hg,Ig,Jg,Kg,Lg,Mg,VG,WG,YG,ZG

DotF Upper: Af,Bf,Cf,Df,Ef,Ff,Gf,Hf,If,Jf,Kf,Lf,Mf
DotF Lower: AF,BO,CF,VF,DF,EF,FO,WF,GF,HF,XF,IQ,JO,KF,YF,LF,MF,ZF

Regions to martinize:
Lower region: dotf_lower, IcmE_lower, IcmK          - 54
Upper Outer: dotd, dotf_upper, duf, Ompa, YiaD      - 79
Upper Inner: dotc, IcmE_upper, nln                  - 42

For the upper section, the distincion between inner and outer is a bit arbitrary, But I had to get the atom count under 99,999, so this arrangement seemed the most logical.

Chain Counting:
dotf_lower: 18
dotf_upper: 13
IcmE_lower: 18
IcmE_upper: 16 (seems to be counted as 32 by gromacs)
nln:        13
duf:        13
Ompa:       14
YiaD:       13
IcmK:       18
DotD:       26
DotC:       13
