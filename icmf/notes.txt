Initial run had too many LINCS warnings to finish minimization.

Will try martinizing again, this time with explicit TERs in the original pdb.

TERs didn't work, now deleting all CONECTs
Still too many LINCS warnings: ATOM 3614-3622
Previously was ATOM ~1450, and ATOM ~8500 ish (not sure exactly which ones)

Will try changing the LINCS warning angle to 45 to try to make it past minimization

Changing the warning angle allowed the whole thing to finish, no problems in Equilibration
